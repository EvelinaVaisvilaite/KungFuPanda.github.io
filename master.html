				<h1>🦊 Master Shifu – The Wise Master</h1>
				<h3> Master Shifu, though a stern and disciplined teacher, is one of the most skilled kung fu masters in the world. Once consumed by the desire for perfection, Shifu learned over time that strength comes not only from skill but from understanding, compassion, and trust in those he mentors.</h3>
				<h4>
					“A warrior must be strong, but also wise. Strength comes from balance.”
